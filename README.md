Linkable Ring Signature System for Anonymous File Sharing | Johns Hopkins University

Developed a secure and privacy-preserving file upload system utilizing linkable ring signatures, combining the Charm cryptographic framework with secp256k1 elliptic curves to achieve a balance between anonymity and accountability.
Implemented key features such as the integration of a unique identifier y0 = H(gskid), enabling the linking of signatures from the same signer to prevent abusive behaviors without revealing identities.
Conducted in-depth analysis of the implications of different identifier constructions on linkability and anonymity, demonstrating strong understanding of cryptographic principles.
Explored potential applications of the system in whistleblowing and decentralized environments, promoting integrity and self-regulation within communities and organizations.
